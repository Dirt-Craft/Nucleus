# API Updates

## Updated `NucleusSendToSpawnEvent`

Plugins can now make use of Nucleus' spawn system but change the location a player spawns, and use the new `SPAWN_EVENT_TYPE` event context key to
 determine whether a redirect should happen.
 
With massive thanks to Brycey92 for this feature - he developed this for his plugin `WarpSpawns`.

(Aside: Do you have a plugin that uses Nucleus in some way? We'd love to hear about it - I may well start a showcase on the Ore/Nucleus docs pages.)
