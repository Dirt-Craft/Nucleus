# Minor updates

* Vanish status is now added to /seen if you have the `nucleus.vanish.see` permission
* `/seen` will no longer paginate in the console

# Bug Fixes

* Fix players with vanish permission sometimes logging in as vanished, even without permission to do so (this is a config option, 
`vanish.force-nucleus-vanish`, but is set to true by default).
