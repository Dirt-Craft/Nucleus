# New features

## Added `/clearback` command

This allows admins to remove a player's `/back` target.

## Added configuration key to allow handling respawns to be turned off

This allows for compatibility with some mods that handle respawns on their own. 

# Minor Updates

* The config entry `warp.separate-permissions` now defaults to `true`, as this will be removed in v2 and this will be the default behaviour. This
 does not affect current configuration files.

# Bugfixes

* Fixed German translation typo (thanks to Retoc)
* Made `/back` backed implementation simpler, resolving a bug where the `/back` target becomes inaccessible.
* Fixed message key error on `/ext`
* Fixed issue where Nucleus would not handle player spawning if Nucleus' `/setspawn` was not set on a world.
