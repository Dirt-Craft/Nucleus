# Minor Updates

Added a way to turn language autodetection off if "default" is selected for the language, forcing "en_GB" 

# Bugfixes

* Language selection should now accept either `-` or `_` in the config entry
* Warps in `/warp list` should no longer show as unavailable when the world they point to is unloaded and could be loaded.
* Calling `asMutable` on the staff chat message channel no longer causes the formatting to drop.
