# Feature Updates

## Added option to restrict `/back` to same dimension

Much like `/home` and `/tpa` can be restricted to the same dimension, the ability to restrict `/back` has also been added.

## Added option to trigger the `/tpa` cooldown when a request is sent, rather than on teleport

Allow modifying when the cooldown is triggered for `/tpa` to when `/tpa` is run, rather than if a teleport is accepted.

# API Updates

## Added `NucleusFreezePlayerService`

An API has been added to allow plugins to detect whether a player is frozen using the Nucleus system.

# Minor Updates

* Along with the addition of the freeze player service, the performance of the freeze player system has been enhanced.

# Bug Fixes

* Fix issue where world unloads were happening a tick later than they should have been
* Remove mod bypass listener (as it was based on a faulty assumption and didn't work anyway)
* Ensure warps and such are available for the API during startup.
